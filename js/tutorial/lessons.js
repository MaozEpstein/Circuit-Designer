// Every tab uses the same staged-build pedagogy: one concept per step,
// each step preloads the previous solution via startsFrom, the build

    summary: 'Step 4 gave you the clean ALU: 6 inputs, 2 outputs, hidden internals. This step puts back the 6 diagnostic LEDs from steps 1–3 ALONGSIDE the MUX / Y outputs from step 4. Now you can see every sub-result (AND, OR, SUM-as-ADD-or-SUB) lighting up in parallel on every cycle. The MUX is just a selector — change OP and Y switches between the same 4 results that were always there. This is how a real CPU\'s datapath actually works: every functional unit runs every cycle, the opcode just decides whose answer counts.',

      body: `<p><strong>What you put together over the five steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Step 1 — Bitwise AND/OR.</strong> Parallel gates per bit slice — the trivial part of any ALU.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 2 — Adder chain.</strong> Two F-ADDs in carry sequence — bit 0\'s COUT feeds bit 1\'s CIN. Pure ADD with CIN=0.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 3 — Subtractor reuse.</strong> The same adder does SUB too: XOR each B with OP0, feed OP0 as CIN. When OP0=1 the adder computes <code>A + NOT(B) + 1 = A − B</code>. ONE adder, TWO operations.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 4 — 4:1 MUX.</strong> Two MUXes (one per output bit) pick which of ADD / SUB / AND / OR reaches Y, controlled by <code>OP1:OP0</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Step 5 — X-ray view.</strong> All 6 internal LEDs back on the canvas. The big reveal: every sub-result is computed every cycle — the MUX only filters. Change OP and Y switches between answers that were already on the wires.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why this matters beyond this lesson:</strong> the ALU you just built is a miniature of <em>every</em> ALU in <em>every</em> RISC CPU. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The adder-reuse trick</strong> in step 3 is universal: no modern CPU has a separate subtractor. The 8-bit ALU you wired into the cpu-build track uses the exact same trick — it has 8 F-ADDs and 8 XOR gates and one extra control bit, and that is the whole story.</li>
  <li><strong>The MUX-per-output-bit pattern</strong> in step 4 scales directly: a 32-bit ALU uses 32 MUXes, all sharing the same opcode selectors. The structure is identical, just wider.</li>
  <li><strong>The "all paths compute, MUX picks" mental model</strong> from step 5 is how every datapath in modern silicon works — and is also why CPUs are fast. They never decide "what to compute" before computing it; they compute everything in parallel and let the opcode filter the result. This is also the WB MUX you wired in cpu-build step 5 and the forwarding MUXes in the MIPS 5-stage demos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever the rest of the course says "the ALU does X", this is the gate-level reality.</p>`,

`First set A=3 (A1=1, A0=1) and B=1 (B1=0, B0=1) and leave them there. Then run these four input changes in order, one at a time, and read all 8 LEDs after each:


(1) OP1=0, OP0=0  →  ADD.
    Expect Y=0  (3+1 = 4, wraps mod 4).


(2) OP0=1  →  SUB.
    Expect Y=2  (3-1 = 2). SUM_OUT also flips to 2.


(3) OP0=0, OP1=1  →  AND.
    Expect Y=1  (11 AND 01 = 01).


(4) OP0=1  →  OR.
    Expect Y=3  (11 OR  01 = 11).


The whole point: AND_OUT stays at 1 in all four cases. OR_OUT stays at 3 in all four cases. They never go dark — the gates run every cycle. Y is the only thing that "follows OP", and it just picks one of the values that were already lit on the wires.`,
